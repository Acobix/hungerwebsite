<p> Instructions: </p>
<p> To get a food plan made by Help For Hope you need to first complete a certain amount of steps. </p>
<p> First we would like you to go on MyPlate.gov by clicking on the image or side links. </p>
<p> Then we need you to fill out the questions to get the amount of nutrients you need in each section of the MyPlate to have a healthy meal everyday. </p>
<p> You may then be able to go ahead and fill out the google form with questions on your MyPlate results. </p>
<p> Or if you'd like you can click on the SNAP program to learn more about it and or fill out a SNAP appliction if needed. </p>
<p> If you only fill out the MyPlate questions that is fine but you would only be getting a dietary plan using local food pantries and banks but if you have the SNAP program we would be using both to better help you on having a nutritious meal everyday.</p>

<p> Help For Hope would then get back to you in about 1-3 business days after filling out the google form with your filled out dietry plan via email :) </p>
